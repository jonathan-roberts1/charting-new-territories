[**Charting New Territories: Exploring the Geographic and Geospatial Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs**]()

Jonathan Roberts, Timo LÃ¼ddecke, Rehan Sheikh, Kai Han, Samuel Albanie

We conduct a series of experiments exploring various vision capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within these domains, particularly focusing on the frontier model GPT-4V, and benchmark its performance against open-source counterparts. Our methodology involves challenging these models with a small-scale geographic benchmark consisting of a suite of visual tasks, testing their abilities across a spectrum of complexity. The analysis uncovers not only where such models excel, including instances where they outperform humans, but also where they falter, providing a balanced view of their capabilities in the geographic domain.
